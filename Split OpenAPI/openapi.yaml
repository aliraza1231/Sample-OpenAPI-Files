  title: Swagger Petstore - OpenAPI 3.0
  description: >-
    This is a sample Pet Store Server based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification. 
    You can find out more about

    Swagger at [http://swagger.io](http://swagger.io). In the third iteration of
    the pet store, we've switched to the design first approach!

    You can now help us improve the API whether it's by making changes to the
    definition itself or to the code.

    That way, with time, we can improve the API in general, and expose some of
    the new features in OAS3.
